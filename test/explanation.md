I compared the outputs of a processed browser library to make sure the results are the same

1. with my fix: RF 5 + code from this branch
2. original: RF 4.1.3 + code from main branch

There are slight differences, but I didn't have time to look into them in detail..
Maybe this is just due to the chances in LibDoc Data Types implementation
